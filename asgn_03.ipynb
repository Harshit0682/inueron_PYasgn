    "Functions offer several advantages in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions allow you to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable pieces of code. Each function\n",
    " can focus on a specific task, making the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Once we've written a function to perform a certain task, we can reuse it multiple times throughout our\n",
    " program or even in different projects. This saves time and reduces the need to duplicate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Using well-named functions with clear purposes improves the readability of our code. Instead of having a \n",
    "long sequence of instructions, we can call functions with meaningful names that indicate their purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions allow we to encapsulate complex logic behind a simple interface. This abstraction hides the \n",
    "intricate details of how a task is accomplished, making it easier for other developers to work with your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Functions can be tested individually, making it easier to identify and fix bugs. Isolating functions for \n",
    "testing reduces the scope of potential issues and speeds up the debugging process.\n"

    "Function:\n",
    "A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the def keyword \n",
    "(in languages like Python) or similar syntax in other languages. The function contains a set of instructions that are\n",

    "Function Call:\n",
    "A function call is an instruction that tells the program to execute the code inside a specific function. When a function\n",
    " is called, the program transfers control to the function's code block, executes the instructions within it, and then \n",
    "returns control back to the point in the program where the function was called. To call a function,we use the \n",

    "within functions or other scopes. The global scope exists throughout the entire execution of the program.\n",

    "Local scopes are created whenever a function is defined. Variables, functions, and classes defined within a function's code\n",
    "block are considered to be in the local scope of that function. These entities are accessible only within the function\n",
    "where they are defined, and they cease to exist once the function finishes executing. Local scopes are created and \n",
    "estroyed as functions are called and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "question6\n",
    " the variables that were defined within the local scope of that function are no longer accessible and are effectively\n",
    " destroyed. This is because local variables only exist within the context of the function execution. Once the function \n",
    "finishes executing and returns a value (or terminates without returning anything), the local scope is cleaned up, and the\n",
    " local variables within it are reclaimed by the system's memory management.\n",
