    "Tuples and lists are both data structures used to store collections of items in programming, but they have some key differences in terms of their \n",
    "characteristics and usage. Here's a comparison between tuples and lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability:\n",
    "Lists: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their content after they are created. we can add, remove, or modify elements within a list.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Once a tuple is defined, its elements remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "Lists: Lists are defined using square brackets []. Elements are separated by commas.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are defined using parentheses (). Elements are also separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "Lists: Lists are often used when we need a collection that can be modified dynamically, such as when we are adding, removing, or changing elements frequently.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are used when we want to store a fixed collection of elements that should remain unchanged. They are often used to represent structures with different\n",
    "attributes, like a point with x and y coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "Lists: Lists might have slightly more memory overhead and computational cost due to their mutability. This is because the list needs to manage potential changes\n",
    "and dynamic resizing.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are more memory-efficient and have slightly better performance, especially when used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, because their \n",
    "immutability ensures they can be safely used in these scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods and Operations:\n",
    "Lists: Lists have various methods for modifying, sorting, and searching their elements. Some common methods include append(), insert(), remove(), and sort().\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples have fewer methods since they are immutable. They mainly support operations like indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n"
